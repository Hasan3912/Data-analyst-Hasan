# About This Portfolio

This portfolio presents a complete collection of AWS cloud-based projects and weekly implementations completed as part of a 10-week course at University Canada West. It covers end-to-end data engineering concepts including:

- Data Ingestion  
- Data Cleaning  
- Data Summarization  
- Data Analysis  
- Data Enrichment  
- Data Security  
- Data Governance  
- Data Observability  

All tasks were performed using core AWS modules such as **Amazon S3**, **AWS Glue**, **AWS DataBrew**, **Amazon Athena**, and **Amazon EC2**—demonstrating real-world cloud architecture, ETL pipelines, and analytics workflows.

The final project was delivered in two parts and focused on analyzing **urban water system performance** using open data from the **City of Vancouver**. The dataset titled **"Issued Operating Permits – Water Systems"** included 594 records filtered for the Downtown area, detailing system types like cooling towers and water treatment units.

We used AWS tools to process and visualize trends in:

- **Average Temperature**  
- **Average Turbidity**  

plotted over **Permit Renewal Dates** to evaluate changes in water quality and maintenance practices.

This portfolio reflects practical experience in designing cloud infrastructure and executing data workflows using AWS technologies

## 🗕️ Weekly Breakdown

### Week 2: Infrastructure Design & Problem Definition

### Project Description:
This week focused on establishing the foundational architecture for conducting descriptive analytics on customer purchase data from UCW’s Finance Department. The emphasis was on understanding business questions, analyzing operational datasets, and preparing a secure and scalable environment for data ingestion and analytics.

### Objective:
To analyze the business question provided by the finance department, identify relevant datasets and metadata, and create a cloud-based data lake (AWS S3) with a structured folder and tagging system to support future data ingestion and transformation processes.


### Data set Used:
This project utilized simulated transaction-like datasets from the UCW Finance Department. Each file represents a key academic or administrative process.

| File Name           | Format | Description                                  |
|---------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| Course Registration | CSV    | Records of student course enrollments       |
| Course Scheduling   | CSV    | Course and timetable scheduling data        |
| Server Log          | CSV    | System/server access records                 |
| Staff Tasks         | CSV    | Task assignments and completions for staff  |
| Student Feedback    | CSV    | Collected feedback entries from students     |
| Student Holds       | CSV    | Administrative holds placed on students      |
| Support Tickets     | CSV    | Help desk and student service ticket records |

**Implementation**
- Launched EC2 instance using `t3.micro`
- Created `finance-raw-bim` S3 bucket
- Uploaded raw datasets and structured folders by type/frequency

### Week 3: Data Ingestion & Cleaning Pipeline

### Project Description:
This phase involved preparing the raw customer purchase data for descriptive analysis. Tasks included designing a cleaning strategy, evaluating storage and processing costs, and implementing the ingestion and transformation pipeline using AWS Glue and S3.

### Objective:
To implement a structured data ingestion process for customer transaction data, perform cleaning operations such as handling null values and standardizing formats, and estimate costs of storing and managing the data within AWS—ensuring the datasets are analytics-ready for further processing in Week 4.


**Design**
- Cleaning strategy in Excel: null handling, format standardization, deduplication plan
- Cost estimation using AWS Pricing Calculator and S3 Storage Lens

### Week 4: Profiling & ETL Implementation

### Project Description:
This week focused on profiling and transforming datasets from the UCW Finance Department using AWS Glue DataBrew. The goal was to prepare clean, analytics-ready outputs in both user-friendly and system-optimized formats using proper compression and partitioning.

###  Objective:
To conduct column-wise profiling, apply cleaning operations, and generate dual outputs:
- **CSV** for user-readable reports
- **Parquet + Snappy** for efficient system storage and querying

### 🛠Design
- Created new S3 folder structure under `/cleaning/user/` and `/cleaning/system/`
- Selected key columns (e.g., platform, failure_reason) for **partitioning strategy**
- Planned two output pipelines:
  - CSV → for business users
  - Parquet (Snappy + partitioned) → for system use

### Implementation
- Built Glue DataBrew projects for each dataset
- Performed profiling to check for:
  - Missing values
  - Data type mismatches
  - Formatting issues
- Applied column-wise transformations and rules
- Generated:
  - `User Outputs` → CSV files
  - `System Outputs` → Partitioned Parquet files with compression
- Verified outputs and partition structure in S3
